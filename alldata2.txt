It is hard to imagine how biodiversity and iconic animals can be preserved, if not for continued carbon storage by deep ocean and clean water, and coastal protection. It's difficult to imagine that tourism and food and non-food production can continue, without clean water and stable climate and coastlines. In the main, while I personally appreciate the incredible wealth from the ocean, and would be saddened to lose any of these benefits, humans have seemingly done their best to threaten the health of our oceans, lands, rivers, and climate. I'd give the vote to diverse other species over the thoughtless amongst our own species, who don't seem moved enough to consider sacrificing any personal conveniences, to save the health of the world that supports us."

Carbon dioxide is needed to sustain photosynthesis for plants to survive and produce oxygen and thus life itself. We each breathe out 2 lbs of CO2 per day,7B people, 14B lbs, 7M tons of CO2 produced each day by breathing alone, think about it.
