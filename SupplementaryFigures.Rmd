**Figure S2**  Relative importance of all demographic and attitudinal variables that have a significant effect on relative importance of Food Provision.  The thick horizontal bars represent medians, the bottom and top of the boxes are the first and third quartile values, respectively, and the whiskers extend 1.5 times the inter-quartile range beyond those. Letters indicate significant differences (Tukey's HSD) for categorical variables and the slope (S), its standard error (SE), and the p-value (linear regression) are reported for continuous variable.
